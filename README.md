# Autism Prediction Using Machine Learning
Autism presents as a neurological condition impacting various aspects of social interaction, communication, and behavior in individuals. Challenges with eye contact, social engagement, learning abilities, and other behavioral nuances characterize this disorder.

However, diagnosing autism lacks a definitive method due to the absence of specific diagnostic tests. Yet, considering the potential of machine learning, there arises an intriguing possibility: leveraging computational models to predict the likelihood of autism in individuals.

This model uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether a person suffers from Autism or not.
